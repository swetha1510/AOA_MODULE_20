# EX 2A BACKTRACKING - RAT IN MAZE PROBLEM
## DATE:
## AIM:
To implement the Rat in a Maze problem using backtracking and find all possible paths from the start to the destination in a given maze.


## Algorithm
1.Initialize a solution matrix sol[N][N] with all zeros.

2.Start from cell (0, 0) â€” check if it is safe to enter:

3.Use isSafe(maze, x, y) to check if the cell is inside the grid and its value is 1.

4.Define recursive function solveMazeUtil(x, y, sol):

5.If x == N-1 and y == N-1, i.e., destination is reached:

6.Mark sol[x][y] = 1 and return True.

7.Mark current cell in solution path: sol[x][y] = 1.

8.Try moving in two directions:

9.First, try moving down (x+1, y). If this leads to a solution, return True.

10.If not, try moving right (x, y+1). If this leads to a solution, return True.

11.Backtrack: Unmark this cell in the solution (sol[x][y] = 0) and return False.

12.If no path is found starting from (0, 0), print "Solution doesn't exist".

13.If a path is found, print the solution matrix, where 1 marks the path from start to goal.

    if solveMazeUtil(maze, x, y+1, sol):
        return True
    
    sol[x][y]=0
    return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    maze = [ [1, 0, 0, 0],
             [1, 1, 0, 1],
             [0, 1, 0, 0],
             [1, 1, 1, 1] ]
              
    solveMaze(maze)

## Output:

## Result:
The Rat in a Maze program executed successfully, and a valid path from the start to the destination was found and display.
